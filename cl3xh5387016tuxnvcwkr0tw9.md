## Create your first React App

Hi There

In this Article we will build a simple react app

# Required Packages

There is two required packages:
1. Package Manager like npm, yarn and etc.
2. Node installed on your computer.

# Create the App
1. Create the project folder

I will name the folder ```react-application```

> NOTE: Don't put any uppercase or space in the name of the folder

2. Run the terminal

If you on windows open terminal and go to the folder 
If you on mac do as in windows

Run the following Command in the terminal:
```bash
npx create-react-app ./
```

3. Open it on your code editor

You can open it on your own code editor but in this case i am using visual studio code so i will run ```code .``` in the terminal in the project directory

# See the result and learn project structure

once you opened the project on your code editor go to the terminal and run the following commands:
```bash
# Yarn
yarn start
# npm
npm start
```

if you run the app with the previous commands it will automatically opened a new tab in your browser on ```http://localhost:3000```

Now you can see the following page:
