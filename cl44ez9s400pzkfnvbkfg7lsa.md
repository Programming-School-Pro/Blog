## My Portfolio

Well, I guess that since I started my first online course on web development I knew that one of the milestones was to create and deploy my very own portfolio website. I must admit that this is not my first ever try to make a portfolio, but every time I started to design something even close to a portfolio I got stuck on some small thing like "I don't truly know how CSS Grid works" or "That's a shiny technology, I, of course, want to use that!" and had to start from the beginning or read up on some documentation to be able to progress. But now, after a fairly long (no that long) journey along the Developmentroad, I can stand up straight and show you all my very own portfolio website. A heads-up to you all: I might seem almost smug about it, but heck yeah, this is a milestone for me. I can't wait to share it with you!

# The Goal

The goal was to build something from the ground up, that was responsive and worked on most screens and browsers. Design-wise I tried to keep it free from clutter and be easy to navigate. Also, I tried to have accessibility in mind throughout the development. I have tried to add features that I like and tried to display it in a simple and nice way, like a dark mode toggle in the upper right corner.

# Overview

The site is a many pages website. All the data used in the Work section is stored in a Sanity platform to have it all in one place and to easily map out the content.

# Tools and tech

I used ***React*** to create the site, mostly since I really like the workflow of React and the components based way, which makes development easy and effective (in my opinion).

It's always hard, I think, to find the best icons to use, I am using font-awesome and react-icons.

# Challenges

Work section: Here I used the Sanity API to access all the data I wanted to display, and sent all the data as a state in the component. This made it easy to use the map method to render the data out.

Dark mode: Here I used the React Context to store and access the light and dark theme colours. In the past, I have used Redux for this kind of operation but I found Context to work a bit easier.

# What to come

This is a tricky part, but I think my portfolio site will be a continuous project and that it will keep on evolving with new features along the way, but it will be without deadlines from now on.

But in the closest future I think I will add:

- A contact form with Sanity
- Add more projects in the Work section.
- ...And more Blog Posts in the Blog section.

# A big thanks!
