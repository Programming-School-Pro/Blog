## 15 Libraries to Increase Your Productivity ðŸŽ¨ðŸš€

If you have created several web apps, the chances are you have been created the same components over and over again. Components like buttons, navigations, sliders, modals, tooltips, alerts, badges, and so on are often reused in most modern web apps.

So, why reinvent the wheel each time? It is repetitive and takes a lot of your time. How about there was a solution where the layout boilerplate for components was already there and you could just pass in the necessary data?

Other developers have come across this problem too, thus many of the component libraries have been created as a solution for you to use and significantly improve your developer workflow.

In this article, I tried to compile a useful list of some of the most popular React component libraries out there. They are easy to get started with and have great docs to assist with.
